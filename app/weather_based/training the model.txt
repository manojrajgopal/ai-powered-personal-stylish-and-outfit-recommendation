Model Training and Evaluation## Method 1When you run `train.py`, it generates the trained model files: `image_features.pkl` and `processed_data.pkl`.    ðŸ“Œ To run the script, navigate to the `weather_based` directory:bash	cd weather_based	python training/train.py## Method 2ðŸ“Œ Alternatively, you can use the pre-trained model files (which I have already trained).ðŸ”— https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e8YIvwOblBypcZKz0Iy5wMR3KxaGjkXs?usp=sharingDownload the pre-trained model files and place them in the weather_based directory: cd weather_basedand place them in the following path:weather_based/data: image_features.pkl, processed_data.pklweather_based/models/saved: recommendation_data.pkl, recommender_model.pklweather_based/testing/evaluation_results: 2025-04-18_full_results.pkl, evaluation_results.pklðŸ“Œ To test the modelbash	python -m testing.testðŸ“Œ For visualization, you can execute the evaluation script:bash	python evaluation.py
